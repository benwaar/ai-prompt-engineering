# Utala Card Back

Prompt-engineering exercise using ChatGPT and DALL·E to create a card-back image for the "Utala" Trading Card Game.

This repository stores the prompt resources and rendered assets produced while iterating on the card-back design.

## Contents

- `prompts/` — prompt text and macros used to generate images.
- `renders/` — final and intermediate render outputs (backgrounds, emblems, backs).
- `docs/` — notes and changelog.

## Usage

This project is primarily a collection of prompts and images. To reproduce or continue work:

1. Edit or create new prompt files in `prompts/`.
2. Use your preferred image-generation workflow (DALL·E, Midjourney, local models) with the prompt text.
3. Add resulting images to `renders/` and update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with notes about iterations.

## Notes

- Files in this repo may contain iterative drafts and experimental prompts.
- No executable code is included — this is a design asset repository.

## License

Include a license file if you intend to share or reuse these assets publicly.
