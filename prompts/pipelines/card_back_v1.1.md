> [COLOR_SYSTEM]

[COMPOSITION]
Symmetrical card back. Three interlocking geometric forms (yellow circle, blue triangle, brown crescent/arc) converging to a luminous green central convergence symbol.  
Central embossed “UTALA” in sleek uppercase sans-serif, slightly sharper and more defined than v1.0.

[DETAILS]
Zen brush rings + thin sci-fi circuit tracery + faint Toki Pona glyphs along border.  
Increase green aura intensity and spread by about 10%, keeping it soft and radiant.  
Maintain perfect rotational symmetry and strong separation in grayscale.
